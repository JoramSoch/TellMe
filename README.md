### Brain region identification for SPM software package in fMRI data analysis

This little collection of scripts can be used for brain region identification in the SPM results window. The two main features are "command-line accessibility" and "syntactical flexibility". Requests can be simply entered into the MATLAB command window with an open SPM results window using `TellMe.m` and this function can be called with 0-6 input arguments. For more information, type `help TellMe` into the MATLAB command window. Further information can be found in `TellMe_manual.pdf` and sources of brain map material are given in `TellMe_sources.pdf`.
